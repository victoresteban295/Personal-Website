                Iâ€™m a 1st generation Mexican American 
                born and raised in South Central Los Angeles. I attended 
                Animo Ralph Bunche Charter High School and obtained my high 
                school diploma in June 2016. After graduating from high school, 
                I moved to Michigan to pursue my undergraduate studies at 
                Albion College and became the first in my family to attend 
                college. While at Albion, I became involved in many organizations 
                and clubs, such as the Engineering Club, Organization 
                for Latinx Awareness (OLA), and Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity. 
                Through these organizations, I had the opportunity to organize 
                and participate in many events that included fraternity recruitment, 
                fundraisers for St. Jude, and Latinx cultural events. 
                On top of that, I became the vice president of the Engineering Club 
                and the director of recruitment for Tau Kappa Epsilon. 
                In May 2021, I graduated from Albion College and obtained my 
                Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science with a minor in 
                Applied Mathematics.
